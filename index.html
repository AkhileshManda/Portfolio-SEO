        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am a goal-oriented person. I work hard and work smart to reach my goal. My short term goals are to build upon the coding languages I have begun to learn and eventually take part in events and hackathons, I also want to keep my fitness levels up and try to play basketball at a higher level. I  enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them, so my goal is to make as many friends as possible as soon as I start my offline mode of  classes.</p>
        <p>Sports has been an integral part of my life so my long term goal will be to promote sports amongst the youngsters, I have already started my journey by teaching some of the kids in my society the game of basketball. I also want to become successful coder and entrepreneur in the future. Listening to many ted talks has motivated me. I would love it if I ever were given a chance to become a ted speaker.</p>
