            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Akhilesh Manda. I live in the Silicon Valley of India, Bengaluru. I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree @IIIT Vadodara. Motivating, Fun, and Perfectionist are some of the qualities that my closest friends will tell you that I possess. I enjoy meeting different people and communicating with them. I also spend my weekends attending toastmaster clubs and occasionally a few MUN’s.</p>
            <p>I love exploring new technologies and build fun apps with them. This Web Portfolio is my first web dev project. Hope you Like it.😊</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I am a goal-oriented person. I work hard and work smart to reach my goal. My short term goals are to build upon the coding languages I have begun to learn and eventually take part in events and hackathons. I also want to keep my fitness levels up and try to play basketball at a higher level. I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them, so my goal is to make as many friends as possible as soon as I start my offline mode of classes.</p>
            <p>Sports has been an integral part of my life so my long term goal will be to promote sports amongst the youngsters. I have already started my journey by teaching some of the kids in my society the game of basketball. I also want to become a successful coder and entrepreneur in the future. Listening to many TED talks has motivated me. I would love it if I ever were given a chance to become a TED speaker.</p>
